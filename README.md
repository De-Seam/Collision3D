# Collision3D
3D collision functions between different shapes. This project is made for learning purposes and includes very bare-bone 3D collision functions.

It currently includes the following detection methods:
- AABB-AABB
- AABB-Sphere
- Sphere-Sphere
- Model-Model using the Separating Axis Theorem
- Model-Model using the Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi distance algorithm (GJK)
- Model-Sphere using GJK
- Model-AABB using GJK

###Use
To use simply download the files and open the "Collision3D.sln" file. It requires Visual Studio to run.
